Dear Sir or Madam,  
 
My name is George Willoughby, and Iâ€™m a freelance journalist writing a story for the Eastern Eye. I am sending this request under the Freedom of Information Act to ask for the following information.
 
1.  The total number of new full time serving police officers [not specials or administrative staff] recruited by your force for the uplift. I would like this broken down by age range, gender and ethnicity. 
 
I would like the information from:
1 October 2019 to 30 September 2020.
1 October 2020 to 31 May 2021
 
2. A complete breakdown of your current serving officers [not specials or administrative staff].
They should be broken down into age range, gender, ethnicity and rank. These should be for the financial or accounting year for 2019/20 and 2020/21, and data for a particular year should be clearly marked.
 
3. A complete breakdown of the number of applicants who applied for officer roles. This should be broken down into age range, gender, ethnicity.
 
4. A complete breakdown of the number of officers shortlisted for officer roles. This should be broken down into age range, gender, ethnicity.
 
If it is not possible to provide the information requested due to the information exceeding the cost of compliance limits identified in Section 12, please provide advice and assistance, under the Section 16 obligations of the Act, as to how I can refine my request. 
 
Under FOI guidelines you have 20 working days to answer these questions. Please acknowledge receipt of this request.
 
If you are not the right person to deal with this request, please would you kindly pass it to the appropriate colleague and ask them to deal with it?
 
Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
 
George Willoughby
