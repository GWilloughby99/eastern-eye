# Police force demographics

This repo holds the information and documents for my investigation into the demographics of police forces and whether **Operation Uplift** is improving ethnic minority representation.

Available is the [police workforce data](https://news.npcc.police.uk/resources/appendix-tables-for-policing-the-pandemic-report1) which I used to analyse the ethnicity of forces. The first angle was comparing the number of ethnic minority officers in each force compared to the number of ethnic minority residents in the area the force serves.
