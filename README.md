# Eastern Eye

During my master's at Birmingham City University, I worked on data journalism stories for the Eastern Eye newspaper. Thank you to [Barnie Choudhury](https://twitter.com/BarnieChoudhury) for the support both editorially and personally.

I wanted to create a specific repository to show how I approach crime data. This was also the first time I used a coding language (R) to analyse and clean data.

Careful consideration had to go into how I handled caveats in the data, as well as communicating it properly through text and data visualisation.
